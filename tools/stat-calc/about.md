Stats calculator files comes from https://web.archive.org/web/20090319055622/http://rode.doddlercon.com/db/calc/index.php

The purpose to get those files under this repository is to be able to:
- rename variable in order to make it more readable
- customize calculation behavior in order to get sub calculation output (e.g: get just the weapon attack before applying some modifier)
- generate test cases
