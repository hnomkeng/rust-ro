# Using Postgresql as database
**Date**: 2021-12-01

# Context
I used rathena database until now, which is using mysql. However my knowledge of mysql is limited as i mainly use and operate postgresql for years.

# Options evaluation
Either i continue using mysql and learning how to work with it, either i migrate to postgresql.

After evaluating how to migrate ddl from mysql to postgresql, it seemed easily doable.

# Decision
I took the decision to keep rathena database structure and migrate it to postgresql. From there i will probably do changes in database structure (adding column, table, constraints...)
